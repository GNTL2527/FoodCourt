  <h1>CHICKEN ADOBO</h1>
  <div id="ingredients">
  <pre>
    Ingredients:

    1 kg (2.2 lbs) chicken pieces (legs, thighs, or a combination)
    1/2 cup soy sauce
    1/2 cup vinegar (cane or white vinegar)
    1 cup water
    4 cloves garlic, minced
    1 medium-sized onion, sliced
    1 bay leaf
    1 teaspoon whole black peppercorns (or ground pepper to taste)
    2 tablespoons cooking oil
    Optional: 1 teaspoon brown sugar (for a slightly sweeter adobo)
    

    Instructions:
    
    In a large bowl or ziplock bag, combine the chicken pieces, soy sauce, vinegar, minced garlic, bay leaf, and black 
    peppercorns. You can add the optional brown sugar at this point if you prefer a slightly sweeter adobo. Mix well, 
    ensuring the chicken is well coated with the marinade. Let it marinate for at least 30 minutes, or for better 
    flavor, refrigerate it overnight.
    
    In a large skillet or pot, heat the cooking oil over medium heat. Remove the chicken from the marinade, reserving 
    the marinade for later use.
    
    Add the sliced onions to the skillet and saut√© until they become translucent.
    
    Add the chicken pieces to the skillet and brown them on all sides. This helps seal in the flavors and gives 
    the chicken a nice color.
    
    Pour in the reserved marinade and 1 cup of water into the skillet. Bring it to a boil.
    
    Once it boils, reduce the heat to low, cover the skillet, and let the chicken simmer for about 30 to 40 minutes 
    or until the chicken is tender and fully cooked. Stir occasionally.
    
    If you want a slightly thicker sauce, you can remove the chicken from the skillet once it's cooked and let the 
    sauce simmer uncovered for a few more minutes until it reaches the desired consistency.
    
    Serve the Chicken Adobo with steamed rice and enjoy!
    
    Note: Adobo is a versatile dish, and you can adjust the ingredients to suit your taste preferences. Some 
    variations include adding potatoes, hard-boiled eggs, or using pork instead of chicken. Feel free to experiment 
    and make it your own!</pre>

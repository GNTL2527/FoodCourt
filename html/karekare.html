  <h1>KARE-KARE</h1>
  <div id="ingredients">
  <pre>
    Ingredients:

    1 kg (2.2 lbs) oxtail, cut into 2-inch pieces 
    1 cup peanut butter 
    1/2 cup ground roasted peanuts 
    1 large eggplant, sliced into 2-inch pieces
    1 bundle of Pechay 
    1-2 banana blossoms 
    1/2 cup string beans (green beans), cut into 2-inch pieces
    1/2 cup glutinous rice flour (or rice flour diluted in water) for thickening the sauce
    1 tablespoon annatto seeds (atsuete) soaked in 1/4 cup water (for coloring, optional)
    1 medium-sized onion, chopped
    3 cloves garlic, minced
    2 tablespoons cooking oil
    4 cups water (or beef broth)
    Fish sauce (patis) or salt, to taste


    Instructions:

    Prepare the Oxtail (or Tripe):
    In a large pot, add the oxtail pieces and enough water to cover them. Bring it to a boil over medium heat. 
    Simmer and cook the oxtail for about 2 to 3 hours or until they become tender. If you are using tripe, you 
    may need to boil it separately until tender, as tripe takes longer to cook than oxtail.

    Create the Peanut Sauce:
    In a separate bowl, mix the peanut butter and ground roasted peanuts. Gradually add the glutinous rice flour 
    (or rice flour diluted in water) to the mixture to thicken the sauce. Set the peanut sauce aside for later.

    Sauté the Aromatics:
    In a large skillet or pan, heat the cooking oil over medium heat. Sauté the chopped onions and minced garlic 
    until they become translucent and aromatic.

    Add the Boiled Oxtail (or Tripe) and Water (or Beef Broth):
    Add the boiled oxtail (or tripe) to the skillet with sautéed onions and garlic. Pour in 4 cups of water 
    (or beef broth) and bring it to a boil. Lower the heat to a simmer and let it cook for a few more minutes 
    to allow the flavors to meld.

    Thicken the Sauce:
    Add the peanut sauce mixture to the pot. Stir well to combine the peanut sauce with the oxtail and the liquid. 
    The sauce will start to thicken and become creamy. Continue to simmer for about 5 to 10 minutes, stirring 
    ccasionally.

    Adjust the Flavor and Add Vegetables:
    Taste the Kare-Kare and season with fish sauce (patis) or salt according to your preference. Add the annatto water 
    for a vibrant orange color (optional). Next, add the sliced eggplant, Pechay or Chinese Cabbage, banana blossoms 
    (if using), and string beans. Let the vegetables cook until they are tender but still slightly crisp.

    Prepare the Bagoong Sauce:
    In a separate small pan, heat the cooking oil over medium heat. Sauté the minced onion and garlic until fragrant. 
    Add the bagoong (shrimp paste), vinegar, and water. Stir and let it simmer for a few minutes. You can add sugar 
    to balance the flavor if desired.
    
    Serve the Kare-Kare:
    Once the oxtail is tender, the sauce has thickened, and the vegetables are cooked, remove the pot from the heat. 
    Transfer the Kare-Kare to a serving dish and serve it hot with the Bagoong Sauce on the side. It is traditionally 
    served with steamed rice.</pre>

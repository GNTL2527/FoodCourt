  <h1>BEEF KALDERETA</h1>
  <div id="ingredients">
  <pre>
    Ingredients:

    1 kg (2.2 lbs) beef, cut into cubes
    2-3 large potatoes, peeled and cut into chunks
    1 large carrot, peeled and cut into chunks
    1 red bell pepper, cut into chunks
    1 green bell pepper, cut into chunks
    1 cup green peas (fresh or frozen)
    1 cup tomato sauce or tomato paste
    1 cup beef broth or water
    1/2 cup liver spread (or liver pâté)
    1/2 cup grated cheese (commonly Edam or cheddar cheese)
    1/4 cup soy sauce
    1/4 cup cooking oil
    1 medium-sized onion, chopped
    4 cloves garlic, minced
    2 bay leaves
    1 teaspoon ground black pepper
    Salt to taste

    Optional Ingredients:

    1 cup canned chickpeas (garbanzo beans)
    1 cup canned green olives
    1 cup red or green chili peppers, sliced (for a spicier version)


    Instructions:
    
    Marinate the Beef:
    In a large bowl, combine the beef cubes, soy sauce, and ground black pepper. Mix well, ensuring all the beef 
    is coated with the marinade. Cover the bowl and let it marinate for at least 30 minutes. For better flavor, 
    marinate it in the refrigerator overnight.

    Sauté the Aromatics:
    In a large pot or a heavy-bottomed pan, heat the cooking oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onions and minced 
    garlic, and sauté until the onions become translucent and the garlic is fragrant.
    
    Brown the Beef:
    Add the marinated beef to the pot and cook until it is lightly browned on all sides. This helps seal in the flavors 
    and adds depth to the dish.

    Simmer with Tomato Sauce and Beef Broth:
    Pour in the tomato sauce (or tomato paste) and beef broth (or water) into the pot. Add the bay leaves. Stir 
    everything together to combine the flavors.

    Cook until Beef is Tender:
    Bring the mixture to a boil, then lower the heat to a simmer. Cover the pot and let the beef cook for about 
    1.5 to 2 hours or until it becomes tender. The cooking time may vary depending on the type of beef you're using. 
    Stir occasionally to prevent sticking.

    Add Vegetables and Liver Spread:
    Once the beef is tender, add the potatoes, carrots, red and green bell peppers, and green peas. If you're using 
    chickpeas and olives, add them as well. Stir everything together and continue simmering until the vegetables are 
    cooked through.

    Add Liver Spread and Cheese:
    Stir in the liver spread (or liver pâté) and grated cheese. These ingredients add richness and depth 
    to the Kaldereta sauce. Mix until the liver spread and cheese are fully incorporated into the sauce.
    
    Season and Adjust:
    Taste the Kaldereta and season with salt and pepper as needed. Adjust the flavors to your preference.
    
    Optional: 

    Add Spiciness (If Desired):
    If you prefer a spicier Kaldereta, you can add sliced red or green chili peppers to the dish at this point. 
    Adjust the amount based on your heat preference.

    Garnish and Serve:
    Once the vegetables are cooked, and the flavors have melded together, remove the bay leaves. Garnish the Beef 
    Kaldereta with fresh parsley or chopped spring onions. Serve it hot with steamed rice.</pre>
